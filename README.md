# Bioemus - IBEA
Bioemus version compatible with IBEA algorithm to be installed on FPGA

**WARNING**: this code is different from the original one published [Nature Communication](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48905-x), which is instead available on this [github url](https://github.com/Ceramic-Blue-Tim/bioemus/tree/main). It contains major changes in the configuration files (the "rat brain" model) and the possibility to stimulate from an output pin of the board (several changes in the code regarding bioemus-genoa). This repository can be cloned inside a new board and used to run locally the IBEA algorithm, directly on the Ubuntu onboard Processing System   

The folder should be renamed "bioemus".
