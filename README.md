# Bioemus - IBEA
Bioemus version compatible with IBEA algorithm to be installed on FPGA

### **WARNING**: this code is different from the original one published in the [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-48905-x](Nat. Comm. paper), which is instead available on this [https://github.com/Ceramic-Blue-Tim/bioemus/tree/main](github url). It contains najor changes in the configuration files (the "rat brain" model) and the possibility to stimulate (several changes in the code regarding bioemus-genoa). This code can be used to run locally the IBEA algorithm, directly on the Ubuntu onboard Processing System
